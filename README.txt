MOTIF_MathWorks
===============

The goal of this library is to provide example code and the necessary infra-
structure code to call MOTIF from MathWorks tools.  With it, you can simulate
larger systems including behavioral models developed by Analog Devices. 

MOTIF is a behavioral simulator owned by Analog Devices.  For more
